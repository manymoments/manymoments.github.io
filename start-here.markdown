## Basics, Foundations, and Classics

Start with the definition of [Consensus and Agreement](/2019-06-27-defining-consensus/). Then learn about the [network model](/2019-06-01-2019-5-31-models/), the [threshold adversary](/2019-06-17-the-threshold-adversary/) model, and the [power of the adversary](/2019-06-07-modeling-the-adversary/). Many protocols need a [trusted setup phase](/2019-07-19-setup-assumptions/).
The [consensus cheat sheet](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2021-10-29-consensus-cheat-sheet/) gives a quick overview of what is possible and impossible. You can build half a course just from the upper bounds and lower bounds linked from it. 

### Variants of Consensus and Broadcast 

[Approximate agreement](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2022-06-07-approx-agreement-one/) is a variation that considers rational input values.

This post covers several [relaxations of Broadcast](/2019-10-22-flavours-of-broadcast/).



## Synchronous Protocols

The Synchronous model is a good place to start because protocols are simpler. 

- Classic Byzantine agreement protocol for $f\leq n/2$: the [Phase-King](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2022-06-09-phase-king-via-gradecast/).

- Classic Byzantine Broadcast protocol (with a PKI) for $f < n$: the [Dolev-Strong Authenticated Broadcast protocol](/2019-12-22-dolev-strong/). 

- A non-equivocation protocol (with a PKI) for  $f < n$: [Crusader Broadcast](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2022-06-19-crusader-braodcast/). 

More recent State Machine Replication protocols:
- [Sync HotStuff](/2019-11-12-Sync-HotStuff/).
- An [optimal optimistically responsive synchronous protocol](/2020-06-12-optimal-optimistic-responsiveness/).
- A simple, streamlined synchronous protocol called [Streamlet](/2020-05-14-streamlet/). 
- Survey of [authenticated protocols under the synchrony assumption](/2019-11-11-authenticated-synchronous-bft/).


Use of randomization in synchronous agreement protocols:
- For [crash failures](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2023-02-18-rand-and-consensus-1/).
- For [omission failures](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2023-02-19-rand-and-consensus-2/).


## Partially Synchronous Protocols

[Partial synchrony](/2019-09-13-flavours-of-partial-synchrony/) is one of the most used models in real word systems today.


Single shot [Paxos](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2022-11-04-paxos-via-recoverable-broadcast/).


Taking ideas from the Byzantine setting and applying them to the benign setting:
 -  [Benign Hotstuff](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2021-04-02-benign-hotstuff/).
 -  [Simplifing Raft with Chaining](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2021-07-17-simplifying-raft-with-chaining/). 
 -  [Log Paxos](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2021-09-30-distributed-consensus-made-simple-for-real-this-time/) is a modern take on multi-Paxos. 

The Byzantine setting:

- An important building block: [provable broadcast](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2022-09-10-provable-broadcast/).
- Single shot [PBFT](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2022-11-20-pbft-via-locked-braodcast/).
- [Two Round HotStuff](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2022-11-24-two-round-HS/) with SMR and accountability. 
- Single shot to SMR is covered [here](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2022-11-19-from-single-shot-to-smr/).
- [Information Theoretic HotStuff](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2021-09-20-information-theoretic-hotstuff-it-hs-part-one/).

## Asynchronous Protocols

Fundamental lower bound in asynchrony: The  [FLP lower bound](/2019-12-15-consensus-model-for-FLP/) showing the impossibility of consensus under even one crash fault. 

Important building blocks in asynchrony:
1. The [Reliable Broadcast](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2020-09-19-living-with-asynchrony-brachas-reliable-broadcast/) protocol. 
2. The [Reliable Gather](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2021-03-26-living-with-asynchrony-the-gather-protocol/) is a multi-leader generalization of reliable broadcast.
3. We discusses how to measure [round complexity in asynchrony](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2021-09-29-the-round-complexity-of-reliable-broadcast/) and also improved round complexity for reliable broadcast. 

Series on Asynchronous Agreement: 

1. [Define the problem](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2022-03-30-asynchronous-agreement-part-one-defining-the-problem/);
2. present [Ben-Or's protocol](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2022-03-30-asynchronous-agreement-part-two-ben-ors-protocol/);
3. provide a [modern version](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2022-03-30-asynchronous-agreement-part-three-a-modern-version-of-ben-ors-protocol/);
4. Introduce [Crusader Agreement and Binding Crusader Agreement](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2022-04-05-aa-part-four-CA-and-BCA/); 
5. use BCA to efficiently solve [Binary Byzantine Agreement from a strong common coin](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2022-04-05-aa-part-five-ABBA/).
 
Reaching [Asynchronous Agreement on a Core Set](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2023-07-22-agreeemnt-on-a-core-set/).

## State Machine Replication

Define [state machine replication](/2019-10-15-consensus-for-state-machine-replication/) (SMR). 

Levels of [SMR fault tolerance](/2019-10-25-flavours-of-state-machine-replication/). 

The [ideal state machine model and Linearizability](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2021-10-16-the-ideal-state-machine-model-multiple-clients-and-linearizability/). 

The scalability and performance of a State Machine Replication system are not just about [consensus, but also about data and execution](/2019-12-06-dce-the-three-scalability-bottlenecks-of-state-machine-replication/).

How [DAGs improve the performance of SMR](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2022-06-28-DAG-meets-BFT/).

To learn about upper bounds, start with a [simple SMR for crash failures](/2019-11-01-primary-backup/). Then extend SMR to omission failures: [First via single shot](/2020-09-13-synchronous-consensus-omission-faults/) and then via the [lock-commit](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2020-11-30-the-lock-commit-paradigm-multi-shot-and-mixed-faults/) paradigm to [multi-shot consensus](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2020-11-30-the-lock-commit-paradigm-multi-shot-and-mixed-faults/).




## Lower Bounds

Lower bounds give us powerful tools to understand the fundamental limitations and model assumptions. 

### Lower bounds on the size of the adversary:

- Folklore (aka CAP theorem for synchrony): [Consensus with Omission failures](/2019-11-02-primary-backup-for-2-servers-and-omission-failures-is-impossible/) requires $f<n/2$.

- The [CAP theorem for partial synchrony](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2023-07-09-CAP-two-servers-in-psynch/): Any system, in the face of a perceived 50-50 split, can either maintain safety or liveness, but not both.

- Split brain attacks:
  - Dwork, Lynch, Stockmeyer 1988 ([DLS](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Lynch/jacm88.pdf)) lower bound: [Byzantine Consensus in Partial Synchrony](/2019-06-25-on-the-impossibility-of-byzantine-agreement-for-n-equals-3f-in-partial-synchrony/) requires $f<n/3$.
  - CJKR lower bound: Neither Non-equivocation nor Transferability alone is enough for [tolerating minority corruptions in asynchrony](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2021-06-14-neither-non-equivocation-nor-transferability-alone-is-enough-for-tolerating-minority-corruptions-in-asynchrony/).
  - TEEs without state need $3f+1$ in Partial Synchrony because of the [rollback adversary](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2023-06-26-dls-meets-rollback/).

- Fischer, Lynch, Merritt ([FLM](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Lynch/FischerLynchMerritt-dc.pdf)) lower bound: [Byzantine Consensus with no PKI](/2019-08-02-byzantine-agreement-is-impossible-for-$n-slash-leq-3-f$-is-the-adversary-can-easily-simulate/) (or more generally when the adversary can simulate) requires $f<n/3$. 

- Strengthening the FLM lower bound with randomization and a weaker problem: [Crusader Agreement with $\leq 1/3$ error is impossible for $n\leq 3f$ if the adversary can simulate](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2021-10-04-crusader-agreement-with-dollars-slash-leq-1-slash-3$-error-is-impossible-for-$n-slash-leq-3f$-if-the-adversary-can-simulate/).


### Lower bounds on the number of messages

- Dolev and Reischuk 1982 ([DR](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~dolev/pubs/p132-dolev.pdf)) lower bound: [Consensus (even with omission failures) needs a quadratic number of messages](/2019-08-16-byzantine-agreement-needs-quadratic-messages/).
- Extending Dolev and Reischuk to [Byzantine crusader broadcast](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2022-08-14-new-DR-LB/).

### Lower bounds on the round complexity

- Fischer, Lynch, Paterson 1985 ([FLP](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Lynch/jacm85.pdf)) lower bound, three part series: 
  - Consensus must have some initial state that is [uncommitted](/2019-12-15-consensus-model-for-FLP/):
  - This implies [executions with at least $f+1$ rounds in Synchrony](/2019-12-15-synchrony-uncommitted-lower-bound/).
  - The FLP result: [non-terminating executions in Asynchrony](/2019-12-15-asynchrony-uncommitted-lower-bound/).


### Lower bounds due to privacy requirements

-  Ben-Or, Kelmer, Rabin 1994 ([BKR](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/197917.198088)) lower bound: Asynchronous Verifiable Secret Sharing must have a [non-zero probability of not terminating](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2020-07-15-asynchronous-fault-tolerant-computation-with-optimal-resilience/).

### Liveness attacks

- Raft does not guarantee liveness under [omission faults](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2020-12-12-raft-liveness-full-omission/).
