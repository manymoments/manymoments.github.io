_**How you can participate in our study**_
If you are teaching lectures or seminars, we would like to record learning motivation and academic emotions in your courses over the semester.
_How you can benefit from your participation_:

1. You will receive immediate feedback on the current learning motivation and academic emotions in your course after each survey (automated via a computer dashboard).
   
2. You will receive the ESM data set of your course for your own scientific or didactical use.
   
3. You become a co-author in our ManyMoments article, in which the overall dataset of all participating courses is examined for generalizability and other methodological issues.


If you would like to participate in this study or need more information, please feel free to email: manymoments@uni-leipzig.de


We are looking forward to working together.
