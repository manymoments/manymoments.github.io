Imagine that that Aliens land on earth with a new superfast SHA256 machine. The machine gives them more than 51% of the hash power of the world. Suppose they decide to build a chain from the [Bitcoin genesis block](https://ittaiab.github.io/2019-07-18-do-bitcoin-and-ethereum-have-any-trusted-setup-assumptions/) that is longer than any other chain on earth and put only empty blocks on it. *Could they erase all bitcoin transactions?*

This is a follow up post to the [setup assumptions of Bitcoin](https://ittaiab.github.io/2019-07-18-do-bitcoin-and-ethereum-have-any-trusted-setup-assumptions/).

Anticipating this type of attack, Satoshi suggested the following [security safeguard](https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/posts/bitcointalk/232/):

So the answer is that the Aliens with a superfast SHA256 will fail. By [default](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/validation.cpp#L120) the bitcoin core client enforces a set of [checkpoints](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/chainparams.cpp#L138). In fact it seems that the person behind the Satoshi email in 2010 suggested to add a checkpoint **in each version from now on***.


A **checkpoint** on a blockchain is pair (block number, hash). For example the checkpoint (295000, 0x00000000000000004d9b4ef50f0f9d686fd69db2e03af35a100370c64632a983) indicates that the hash of the 295000th block must be 0x00000000000000004d9b4ef50f0f9d686fd69db2e03af35a100370c64632a983.
A checkpoint provides **finality**. All the transactions till block 295000 are final, there is no way to revert them, even if you are an alien with a superfast SHA256 machine. 

While some believe this is [not a security feature](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/39097/do-all-bitcoin-client-enforce-checkpoints), it does effectively enforce a consensus decision that forces all users using the same codebase to accept this checkpoint and everything before it as final.

The idea of adding checkpoints by publishing hardcoded values into a [github](https://github.com/bitcoin) repository is somewhat controversial. It's essentially a way for a code base to create a new genesis and effectively disallows any alternative chain from the previous genesis. On the one hand this is a strong security measure but on the other hand this gives non-trivial power to the maintainers of the github repository. The real question then becomes: who decides what will be a checkpoint? who decide how often? what will be its value?  

The Bitcoin core client uses checkpoints in a sporadic manner.  Seems to be used till 2014 and later abandoned. Their motivation seems to be that it [protects against header flooding attacks](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/15095 
). However there seems to be no systematic reasoning as to when to use checkpoints.

The [Casper finality gadget](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09437) can be viewed as a way to use a BFT based sub-system to decide on checkpoints that is governed by a set of validators (instead of a set of Github maintainers). More on finality gadgets in a later post.
