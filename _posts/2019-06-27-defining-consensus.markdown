We all broadly understand "consensus" as the notion of different parties agreeing with each other. In distributed computing, Consensus is one of the core functionalities. In this post, we define the consensus problem and discuss some variants and their differences.

Let us begin with the simplest consensus problem: *agreement*.


## The Agreement Problem
In this problem, we assume a set of $n$ parties where each party $i$ has some input $v_i$ from some known set of input values $v_i \in V$. A protocol that solves Agreement must have the following properties.

**Agreement:** no two honest parties *decide* on different values.

**Validity:** if all honest parties have the same input value $v$, then $v$ must be the decision value.

**Termination:** all honest parties must eventually *decide* on a value in $V$ and terminate.



Obviously, Agreement is easily solvable if all parties are honest and the system is synchronous. To make the problem non-trivial we need to fix the communication model [synchrony, asynchrony, or partial synchrony](https://ittaiab.github.io/2019-06-01-2019-5-31-models/) and then fix the [threshold of the adversary](https://ittaiab.github.io/2019-06-17-the-threshold-adversary/) and other details about the [power](https://ittaiab.github.io/2019-06-07-modeling-the-adversary/) of the adversary.

In the *binary agreement* problem, we assume the set of possible inputs $V$ contains just two values: 0 and 1.

For lower bounds it's often beneficial to define an even easier problem of _agreement  with weak validity_ where we replace validity with:

**Weak Validity:** if all parties are honest and all have the same input value $v$, then $v$ must be the decision value.


### Uniform vs. non-uniform agreement
When the adversary is omission or crash, then the *agreement* property above is called *non-uniform agreement*. 
We can also have a stronger *uniform agreement* property where no two (even faulty) parties *decide* on different values. 
This is called *uniform agreement* and assumes an omission or a crash adversary (this definition is meaningless with malicious corruptions).

For example, the difference will be relevant in a [state machine replication](https://ittaiab.github.io/2019-06-07-modeling-the-adversary/) setting with omission faults. For another example, see [this later post](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2020-09-13-synchronous-consensus-omission-faults/).

## The Broadcast Problem
Here we assume a designated party, often called the leader (or dealer) that has some input $v$. A protocol that solves Broadcast must have the following properties.

**Agreement:** no two honest parties *decide* on different values.

**Validity:** if the leader is honest then $v$ must be the decision value.

**Termination:** all honest parties must eventually *decide* on a value in $V$ and terminate.


Observe that the two problems are [deeply connected](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2020-09-14-broadcast-from-agreement-and-agreement-from-broadcast/). A nice exercise is to try to solve Broadcast given Agreement. Another good exercise is to try to solve Agreement given Broadcast.
