- The ManyMoments project aims to improve the replicability and generalizability of intensive longitudinal studies.

- After several conceptual papers, we are now conducting many-lab ESM data collections to examine the replicability & generalizability of ESM findings.

- As a first empirical example we investigate prior findings about situated expectancy-value experiences in university lectures (Dietrich et al., 2017; Moeller et al., 2022).

- We examine heterogeneity versus generalizability across contexts (different university lectures), as well as across individuals and time points.
