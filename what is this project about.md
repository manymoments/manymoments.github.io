- The ManyMoments project aims to improve the replicability and generalizability of intensive longitudinal studies.

- After several conceptual papers, we are now conducting many-lab ESM data collections to examine the replicability & generalizability of ESM findings.

- As a first empirical example we investigate prior findings about situated expectancy-value experiences in university lectures (Dietrich et al., 2017; Moeller et al., 2022).

- We examine heterogeneity versus generalizability across contexts (different university lectures), as well as across individuals and time points.


_**Central issue**_
Intensive longitudinal studies examine phenomena that change over time, persons, and contexts. This poses challenges to the generalizability and replicability of the obtained data (Table 1). The ManyMoments project is a multi-lab study that aims to improve the replicability and generalizability of intensive longitudinal studies. In its first empirical study, the ManyMoments Project will investigate situated learning motivation and learning-related emotions in university lectures. It will examine the short-term development of situational expectancies and value experiences according to Eccles' expectancy-value theory (Eccles & Wigfield, 2002), and explore heterogeneity and generalizability across individuals, time points, and contexts.

_**Method**_
The Experience Sampling Method (ESM) is used to capture the situation- and context-specific fluctuation of emotions and motivation (for an overview of ESM see Moeller et al, 2023). With ESM, participants are asked about their current psychological state in real-time via mobile devices. Each student will be asked three times per lecture via their smartphone about their current motivation as well as any emotions that arise using ESM surveys (for research design, see also Dietrich et al., 2017 and Moeller et al., 2020). The measurement instruments (described in detail in Dietrich et al., 2017) capture situational expectancy-value experiences as well as measures of situated academic emotions, the latter based on Pekrun and colleagues' previous work on the control-value theory of achievement emotions (e.g., Pekrun, 2006).

_**Implications for practice and science**_
The study serves to further develop theories on learning motivation, emotions, and their developments, as well as to further develop methodological approaches in the survey, analysis, and interpretation of intensive longitudinal studies. In particular, the development of learning motivation within specific courses is analyzed over the course of one semester and can thus also serve instructors to further develop their teaching methods.
